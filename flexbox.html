	<h1>Flexbox</h1>

	<p>Flexbox is a layout mechanism designed for laying out groups of items in one dimension. Learn how to use it in this module.</p>

	<p>A design pattern that can be tricky in responsive design is a sidebar that sits inline with some content.<br> Where there is viewport space, this pattern works great, but where space is condensed, that rigid layout can become problematic.</p>

	<p>The Flexible Box Layout Model (flexbox) is a layout model designed for one-dimensional content.<br> It excels at taking a bunch of items which have different sizes, and returning the best layout for those items.</p>

	<h3>What can you do with a flex layout?</h3>

	<p>Flex layouts have the following features, which you will be able to explore in this guide.<br></p>

	<p>
They can display as a row, or a column.
They respect the writing mode of the document.<br>
They are single line by default, but can be asked to wrap onto multiple lines.<br>
Items in the layout can be visually reordered, away from their order in the DOM.<br>
Space can be distributed inside the items, so they become bigger and smaller according to the space available in their parent.<br>
Space can be distributed around the items and flex lines in a wrapped layout, using the Box Alignment properties.<br>
The items themselves can be aligned on the cross axis.</p>

<h3>The main axis and the cross axis</h3>

<p>The key to understanding flexbox is to understand the concept of a main axis and a cross axis. The main axis is the one set by your flex-direction property.<br> If that is row your main axis is along the row, if it is column your main axis is along the column.</p>

<p>Flex items move as a group on the main axis. Remember: we've got a bunch of things and we are trying to get the best layout for them as a group.<br>

The cross axis runs in the other direction to the main axis, so if flex-direction is row the cross axis runs along the column.</p>

<p>You can do two things on the cross axis. You can move the items individually or as a group, so they align against each other and the flex container. <br>Also, if you have wrapped flex lines, you can treat those lines as a group to control how space is assigned to those lines. <br>You will see how this all works in practice throughout this guide, for now just keep in mind that the main axis follows your flex-direction.</p>

<h3>Creating a flex container</h3>

<p>To use flexbox you need to declare that you want to use a flex formatting context and not regular block and inline layout.<br> Do this by changing the value of the display property to flex.</p>

<p>As you learned in the layout guide this will give you a block-level box, with flex item children.<br> The flex items immediately start exhibiting some flexbox behavior, using their initial values.</p>

<p>All CSS properties have initial values which control how they behave "out of the box" when you haven't applied any CSS to change that initial behavior.<br> The children of our flex container become flex items as soon as their parent gets display: <br>flex, so these initial values mean that we start seeing some flexbox behavior.</p>

<h3>The initial values mean that:</h3>

<p>Items display as a row.<br>
They do not wrap.<br>
They do not grow to fill the container.<br>
They line up at the start of the container.</p>

<h3>Writing modes and direction</h3>

<p>Flex items lay out as a row by default. A row runs in the direction that sentences flow in your writing mode and script direction. <br>This means that if you are working in Arabic, which has a right-to-left (rtl) script direction, the items will line up on the right.<br> Tab order would also begin on the right as this is the way sentences are read in Arabic.</p>

<P>If you are working with a vertical writing mode, like some Japanese typefaces, then a row will run vertically, from top to bottom.<br> Try changing the flex-direction in this demo which is using a vertical writing mode.</P>

<p>Therefore the way flex items behave by default is linked to the writing mode of the document.<br> Most tutorials are written using English, or another horizontal, left to right writing mode. <br>This would make it easy to assume that flex items line up on the left, and run horizontally.</p>

<p>With the main and cross axis plus the writing mode to consider, the fact that we talk about start and end rather than top,<br> bottom, left, and right in flexbox might be easier to understand.<br> Each axis has a start and an end. The start of the main axis is referred to as main-start.<br> So our flex items initially line up from main-start. The end of that axis is main-end. The start of the cross axis is cross-start and the end cross-end.</p>

<h3>Wrapping flex items</h3>

<p>The initial value of the flex-wrap property is nowrap. <br>This means that if there is not enough space in the container the items will overflow.</p>

<p>When a flex container wraps it creates multiple flex lines. In terms of space distribution, each line acts like a new flex container. <br>Therefore if you are wrapping rows, it is not possible to get something in row 2 to line up with something above it in row 1. <br>This is what is meant by flexbox being one-dimensional. <br>You can control alignment in one axis, a row or a column, not both together as we can do in grid.</p>
