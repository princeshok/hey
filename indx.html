	<h1>A Brief History Of Layout</h1>

	<div>

	<p>In the early days of the web, designs more complex than a simple document were laid out with elements.<br> Separating HTML from visual styles was made easier when CSS was widely adopted by browsers in the late '90s. <br> CSS opened the door to developers being able to completely change the look and feel of a website without ever touching HTML. <br> This new capability inspired projects such as The CSS Zen Garden which was created to demonstrate the power of CSS to encourage more developers to learn it.</p>

		<p>CSS has evolved as our needs for web design and browser technology have evolved. <br> You can read how CSS layout and our approach to layout has evolved over time this article by Rachel Andrew.</p>

		<h3>Layout: the present and future</h3>

		<p>Modern CSS has exceptionally powerful layout tooling. <br> We have dedicated systems for layout and we're going to have a high-level look at what we have at our disposal,before digging into more detail of Flexbox and Grid in the next modules.</p>

		<h3>Understanding the display property</h3>

		<p>The display property does two things. The first thing it does is determine if the box it is applied to acts as inline or block.</p>

		<p>Inline elements behave like words in a sentence. They sit next to each other in the inline direction. <br>Elements such as and strong, which are typically used to style pieces of text within containing elements like a (paragraph), are inline by default. <br> They also preserve surrounding whitespace.</p>

			<p>Block elements don't sit alongside each other. They create a new line for themselves. <br>Unless changed by other CSS code, a block element will expand to the size of the inline dimension,<br> therefore spanning the full width in a horizontal writing mode. <br>The margin on all sides of a block element will be respected.</p>

		<h3>Flexbox and Grid </h3>

		<p>There are two main layout mechanisms that create layout rules for multiple elements, flexbox and grid. <br>They share similarities, but are designed to solve different layout problems.</p>

		<p>Flexbox is a layout mechanism for one-dimensional layouts.<br> Layout across a single axis, either horizontally or vertically. <br>By default, flexbox will align the element's children next to each other, <br> in the inline direction, and stretch them in the block direction, so they're all the same height.</p>

		<p>Grid is similar in a lot of ways to flexbox, but it is designed to control multi-axis layouts instead of single-axis layouts (vertical or horizontal space).<br>

<br>Grid enables you to write layout rules on an element that has display:<br> grid, and introduces a few new primitives for layout styling, such as the repeat() and minmax() functions.<br> One useful grid unit is the fr unit—which is a fraction of remaining space—you can build traditional 12 column grids, <br> with a gap between each item, with 3 CSS properties:</p>

<h3>Flow layout </h3>

<p>If not using grid or flexbox, your elements display in normal flow. <br>There are a number of layout methods that you can use to adjust the behavior and position of items when in normal flow.</p>

<h3>Inline block</h3>

<p>Remember how surrounding elements don't respect block margin and padding on an inline element?<br> With inline-block you can cause that to happen.</p>

<h3>Floats</h3>

<p>The float property instructs an element to "float" to the direction specified.</p>

<h3>Multicolumn layout</h3>

<p>Instead of setting the number of columns that the content is split into, <br>you can also define a minimum desired width, using column-width.<br> As more space is made available in the viewport, more columns will automatically be created and as space is reduced,<br> columns will also reduce. This is very useful in responsive web design contexts.</p>

<h3>Positioning</h3>

<p>Last on this overview of layout mechanisms is positioning. <br>The position property changes how an element behaves in the normal flow of the document, and how it relates to other elements.<br> The available options are relative, absolute, fixed and sticky with the default value being static.</p>

<h3>Wrap-up</h3>

<p>There's a lot of choice and flexibility with CSS layout.<br> To dive further into the power of CSS Flexbox and Grid, continue into the next few modules.</p>
